# Optimizing_ML_Pipeline_Azure
# OVERVIEW

This projrct is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. we build and optimize an Azure ML pipline using Azure ML python SDK.
training a Sikit-learn LogisticRegression model and tuning hyperparamter using Azure HyperDrive functionality.
this model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

# SUMMARY

The provided dataset is a markting Bank dataset and we have to predict wethear a client subscribed a term deposit.
we tuned the hyperparameter using HyperDrive then save the best model tuned by HyperDrive, next we use Automated Machine Learning
to get an opitimal model for the dataset, we then compared the two model and find out which result is better
